The first idea to make a personal website came around the middle of 2024. At the time, I had been made redundant at work and was struggling to find work. Despite having a couple of years of experience in the tech industry, it seemed like no one in Germany was hiring or, more likely, that I simply simply wasn't qualified enough. Rejection after rejection after rejection and my savings going lower and lower was very demotivating. At one point, my bank account went down to €50.35 and I had about €20 in my wallet. Luckily I have family support and generous friends so I was never in any real danger, but it was still not a nice place to be in.
Eventually I decided making a simple personal website would be a good idea to show off some of the projects I've worked on, and it could also serve as an online CV of sorts. Whether it would work or not, it would at least be something that could keep me busy and take my mind off things in a productive way.

Before building it, I decided that having a static website would probably be the easiest to maintain. Although initially I was going to code everything from scratch, I soon realised that I could make my life much easier if I used some sort of pre-existing framework. Luckily, I remembered learning about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) about a year ago, and thought I would investigate it further. To manage content, I would much rather write a few markdown files, so the mix of toml files for configuration and markdown for content seemed like a good fit. The fact that it could also have multiple languages was also a nice plus, but I must admit having to translate the same text several times was a bit boring at times. Still, I settled for having the home page and the [about me](/about/about_me.en.md) page in as many languages as possible (for me), and for the [blogs](/blog/) and [projects](/projects/), they can be updated as needed.

Ultimately, I must admit I don't know how often I will update this blog, but I would like to at least keep the [projects](/projects/) section up to date.
