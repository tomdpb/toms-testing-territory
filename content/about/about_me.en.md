# Who am I?

My name is Thomas de Paula Barbosa, though generally I just go by Tom. My main residence is in Germany, where I've been living since October 2019.
I'm passionate about music, natural sciences, computers and programming, languages, and nature.

# Education

I've studied music theory and violin at the Music School of Brasília (CEP-EMB) where I completed the basic in 2015 and graduated the violin technical course in 2019.

I also started studying Physics at the University of Brasília (UnB) in 2018 before moving to Leipzig and studying Physics there at the University of Leipzig (Universität Leipzig). Along the way, I realised that Physics was not for me, and I finally switched to study a bachelor's degree in Computing and IT at the Open University in April 2024.

I'm currently studying for a BSc. (Honours) in Computing and IT at The Open University.

# Spoken Languages

I'm very interested in languages. I've done some research in many languages and scripting systems just out of curiosity. To this day I still remember how I learnt to read the Cyrillic alphabet while I was 14 and was supposed to be studying for a maths exam. Although I'd love to properly learn many more, the ones I currently speak are:

- English (native)
- Portuguese (native)
- Italian (fluent)
- German (approximately C1 level)
- Spanish (conversational)

# Programming Languages

I've got different levels of experience with the following languages, and no, I not counting simple "Hello World!" programs!

- Bash/Shell Scripting
- C++
- GDScript
- Go
- JavaScript
- Julia
- LaTeX
- Python
- R
- Rust
- SQL
- TypeScript
